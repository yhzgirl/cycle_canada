				<p>It all started in 2012. The London Olympics were coming to town and myself and Michelle were living in East London just down the road from the Stadium. I was working in London Bridge and decided to get myself a secondhand cheap fixe on ebay to get me to and from work so I wouldn’t have to use the Tube and that's when the love for cycling started.</p>

				<p>I then found out that my work had a Cycle To Work Scheme so decided to cash in on my first road bike which I still have to this day. I slowly started riding further and further and built a real bond with this bike. Its at this point I decided to enter for the London ride 100 Miles, I've always wanted to raise money for a charity so I got a place in the event through Great Ormond Street Hospital. That's when I realised I was going to have to take this new hobby of mine to a new level. I signed up for a few sportif’s and went out every weekend on my own to make sure I was clocking up the miles.</p>

				<p>August 2013 came and there I was on the start line ready cycle 100 miles around closed roads in London and the Surrey hills with 2 of my best friends. It was amazing! I completed the course in 5 hours 15 mins which I was pretty chuffed with considering I had only been cycling for 1 year and more importantly I raised just over £1000 for the charity which was a great feeling!</p>

				<p>I then got my 2nd bike on the cycle to work scheme, It was time to go full carbon and take my bike tally up to two. I continued using my first road bike to commute to work. I just couldn’t get rid of it. I kept the miles flowing and the sportif’s coming.</p>

				<p>2014 Myself and Michelle moved to West London and closer to Richmond Park and the Surrey Hills. I then acquired a cycling buddy, Michelle got the bug and we started sharing exciting cycling adventures around the UK.</p>

				<p>2015 it was time for another bike. The Cycle To Work Scheme just made it far too tempting to upgrade. I went for a BMC Team Machine SLR02 and it is amazing!! I also started cycling with a club called Sky Velo.</p>

				<p>One day last summer Michelle came home from work and said to me that she wanted to cycle across Canada in 2016. I laughed and thought she was kidding, she obviously wasn’t kidding because here we are and I'm coming along for the ride! I'm so excited and feel really lucky to be able to share an amazing experience like this with her and also be able to raise money for a fantastic cause. I've been though a lot with Michelle and her Crohn’s and I truly believe that exercising regularly is helping her keep her Crohn's under control.</p>

				<p>So onto our next chapter, Canada we are coming! </p>

				<p>Towards the end of 2014 after I had recovered from surgery for Crohn's to remove a damaged section of my stomach I knew I needed to find a way to fit some exercise into my life. I decided the best way would be to cycle the 8.5miles/14km commute to work as cycling would take the same amount of time as the train.</p> 
					
					<p>So I bought a hybrid bike in November (not the best time of year to start) and started cycling in 3 days a week. I was a very nervous rider for the first few months, taking all the side roads, dirt paths even and taking it slow.  As the winter went on I gained confidence and when spring arrived I discovered the joy of riding in the warm sun.</p>

				<p>When I saw notice at work for a London to Oxford ride (60miles/96km) in July I thought it would be something fun for Nathan and I to do together. We signed up and I started training, including coaching sessions offered by Sky. Before I knew it I'd also signed up for Sky Velo and showed up one Sunday for the Windsor Loop ride. I arrived on my hybrid bike, lock still attached, realising when I saw the serious kit the others had I would soon be buying another bike. However they were super friendly and supportive of me that day and I've been enjoying weekend rides with them ever since (on my new road bike).</p>
				
				<p>After completing the Oxford ride (in clip-less shoes no less) I felt like I could take on anything on my bike that I set my mind to, and since I was long overdue for an adventure I decided that some time in my home country on a bike was just the thing. Before I knew it I was googling how long it would take to ride coast to coast across Canada. I then mentioned my idea to Nathan and once he realised I was serious he was on board too.</p>
				
				<p>Plans are now truly under way, we have a map of Canada plastered on our living room wall for route planning, I have a personal trainer whom I see every week (thank you to Sky), we are learning about lightweight tents, sleeping bags, touring bikes, bike maintenance and more.</p>
				
				<p>I love cycling, it’s freeing, fun, a way to explore the world. However the biggest motivator for me to cycle as much as I can, is that since I took up cycling I remain symptom free from Crohn's.  This is why we want to dedicate the cycling across Canada challenge to raising money for the UK and Canadian charities of Crohn's and colitis ($1 for every km), cycling has given me not just happiness but my health too and I plan to make the most of it.</p>
