		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h3>Every time we told a friend or family member of our plans to cycle across Canada they had plenty of questions.  We thought you might have some too and would like to know the answers.</h3>
	</div>
	<section class="questions clearfix">
			<h4><strong>Q: You are doing what?</strong></h4>
			<p>We are cycling across Canada raising money and awareness of an inflammatory bowel disease called Crohn's. We will be cycling self supported, meaning we will carry all our own gear and find accommodation along the way.</p>
			<h4><strong>Q: How long will it take?</strong></h4>
			<p>It's about 7000km/4350miles of cycling total from Vancouver to Halifax. As to how long this takes, there are varing answers. We'd like to enjoy our time cycling across Canada so we'll plan to take in some sites, activities and festivals in order to have things to look forward to along the way. We do have a limited amount of time but the range for this trip seems to be 72 to 100 days.</p>
			<h4><strong>Q: Where will you stay?</strong></h4>
			<p>We'll be using a combination of accommodation friends places, hostels, campgrounds, wild camping and warmshowers.com a cycling community which offers a place to stay (a bed or a yard for a tent) to fellow cyclist.</p>
			<h4><strong>Q: What about bears?</strong></h4>
			<p>We have lots to learn about camping in Canada and how to camp safely amongst bears is one of them.</p>
			<h4><strong>Q: What about your jobs?</strong></h4>
			<p>Michelle's company Sky has a leave of absence policy and she has requested and had approved the 3 months off needed.</p>
			<p>Nathan's company which is much smaller has also been able to granted the time off too, which is great.</p>
