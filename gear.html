When we get back we will add our reviews and let you know if it stood up to the test.</h3> </div> <div class=gear-list> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>The Bikes</h3> <p>Our our first major purchase, our bikes. I'm happy to say when cycling across Canada we'll be on Canadian bikes. Both of us will be riding the Brodie Argus bike. The Argus is a touring bike with a steel frame and disc breaks. A nice sturdy bike with good breaking to help us down the moutains.</p> <img class="center-block img-responsive" src=images/argus.png alt="Brodie Argus Bike"> </div> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>Tent</h3> <p>Our tent will be the roof over our heads most nights. We've chosen the Hubba Hubba NX tent by MRS. This tent strikes the right balance between space, protection from the environment and weight (it's only 1.5kg!).</p> <img class="hubba center-block img-responsive" src=images/hubbahubbatent.jpg alt="MSR hubba hubba tent"> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>Sleeping Bags</h3> <p>Alpkit offered good value for money and after comparing the down and synthetic version of this sleeping bag and being unable to tell the difference we went for the synthetic at almost half the cost.</p> <img class="hubba center-block img-responsive" src=images/mountainGhostAlpkitsleepingbag.jpg alt="Alpkit Mountain Ghost sleeping bag"> </div> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>Panniers</h3> <p>We liked the look, the simplicty, the waterproofing and price of these Crosso Panniers. We have 2 for the front and 2 for the back to help balance the weight on the bike.</p> <img class="hubba center-block img-responsive" src=images/crossoTwistPanniers.jpg alt="Crosso Twist Panniers"> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>Sleeping Mats</h3> <p>To make sure we get a good nights sleep we went for the most comfortable lightest and best insulated sleeping pad we could aford. After a lot of resurch we choose the Thermarest Neoair all season mat in large.</p> <img class="neoair center-block img-responsive" src=images/NeoAir_All_Season.jpg alt="Thermarest Neoair all season sleeping mat"> </div> <div class=col-md-6> <h3>Cooking Stove</h3> <p>The stove we choose is the MSR Superfly. It's small, light, easy to light and easy to find fuel for. It ticks all the boxes. Let's see if Nathan's cooking skills can cook us up something nice with this little guy.</p> <img class="stove center-block img-responsive" src=images/msr_superfly_stove.jpg alt="Crosso Twist Panniers"> </div> </div> <div class="row gear-gallery"> <div class=col-md-6> <img class="hubba center-block img-responsive" src=images/usMSRHubbaHubba.jpg alt="in the MSR hubba hubba tent"> </div> <div class=col-md-6> <img class="hubba center-block img-responsive" src=images/usinmountainGhostAlpkitsleepingbags.jpg alt="testing out the Alpkit sleeping bags"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id=footer></div>  <script src=scripts/plugins.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.js></script> </body> </html>
